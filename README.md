Only use these programs if you know the right answer to this question: 
 - I'm trying to fix a ladder in a garage but it is to long. The garage has a front door and a back door. 
   If I accelerated that ladder to 66% of the speed of light will it fit or not??
   
catch: only one door can be open at any moment.
